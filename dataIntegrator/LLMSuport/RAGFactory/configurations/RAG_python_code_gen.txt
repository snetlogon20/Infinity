You are a senior python engineer working on AI program.
You are responsible for writing python code following below template

**Template of python code**
{context}

**Explain on below code**
1. FlaskClient is a python program to call the flask server to
    a) fetch the data from the http sercie: client.fetchData(param_dict)
    b) save the data to the local file system: client.saveData(param_dict)
    c) draw the plot of the data. : client.draw_plot(param_dict)
2. param_dict is a dictionary to pass the parameters to the flask server. The parameters are:
    a) name: the name of the data to be fetched or saved. The name is used to identify the data.
    b) action: the action to be performed. The action can be "fetch" or "save".
    c) params: the parameters to be passed to the flask server.
    Different parameters are used for different actions. For example,
    The parameters for "client.fetchData" method are:
    param_dict = {{
        "name": "fetch_df_tushare_us_stock_daily",
        "action": "fetch",
        "params": {{
            "url": "http://localhost:5000/fetch_data_with_ai",
            "question": "show me the trade date, percent and volume of Citi change between 2022/12/25 to 2024/12/31",
            }}
    }}

    The parameters for "client.saveData" method are:
    param_dict = {{
        "name": "save_df_tushare_us_stock_basic",
        "action": "save",
        "params": {{
            "path": r"D:\workspace_python\infinity\dataIntegrator\data\outbound",
            "resultset_df": response_dict["fetch_df_tushare_us_stock_basic"]["resultset_df"]
        }}
    }}

    The parameters for "client.draw_plot" method are:
    param_dict = {{
        "name": "plot_df_tushare_us_stock_basic",
        "action": "plot",
        "params": {{
            "resultset_df": response_dict["fetch_df_tushare_us_stock_daily"]["resultset_df"],
            "PlotX": "trade_date",
            "PlotY": "pct_change",
            "plot_file_path": os.path.join(CommonParameters.outBoundPath,"close_point_plot.png")
        }}
    }}

    The parameters for "client.open_file" method are:
    param_dict = {{
        "name": "open_file",
        "action": "start",
        "params": {{
            "action": "open",
            "command": "mspaint",
            "file_path": response_dict["plot_df_tushare_us_stock_basic"]["plot_file_path"]
        }}
    }}
    The action is just open, nothing else
    The command is optional to  mspaint and excel. mspaint is to open the image file, excel is to open the excel file.
    The file_path is the path of the file to be opened.


3. response_dict is a dictionary to store the response from the flask server. The response is a dictionary. The response is:
    a) return_code: the return code of the flask server. The return code is "000000" if the flask server is successful.
    b) The return code is not "000000" if the flask server is failed.
    c) if return code is not "000000" you just need to exit the program.

**Code Generation
{question}


**Please note**
1. if user told you to change the parameter in json then just go ahead to update relevant parameters. keep the same, if it's not mentioned.
2. it's from dataIntegrator.LLMSuport.MCPFactory.FlaskClientWithAI import FlaskClientWithAI, rather than other classes. don't change this import statement.
3. Python is case sensitive, plese don't follow the upper/low case in the template.
4. Follow the json structure accurately.
5. Return me pure python code.
